# Ethically Aligned Design (EAD) with Data protection &amp; Privacy Safeguards

Current digital age is witnessing  an exponential proliferation of sophisticated hardware- and software-based intelligent solutions that are able to interact with the users at almost every sensitive aspect of our lives, collecting and analysing a range of data about us. These data, or the derived information out of it, are often too personal to fall into unwanted hands, and thus users are almost always wary of the privacy of such private data that are being continuously collected through these digital mediums. To further complicate the issue, the infringement cases of such databanks are on a sharp rise. Several frameworks have been devised in various parts of the globe to safeguard the issue of data privacy; in parallel, constant research is also being conducted on closing the loopholes within these frameworks. This study aimed to analyse the  UK GDPR framework (Legislation.gov.uk, 2018) and other frameworks with focus on data protection and privacy by design identify the key challenges and proposed solutions. This research is based on a systematic literature review specifically in telecom , heath care, financial domains.
